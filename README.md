# 👋 Hi, I'm Vaibhav Mahindru  
**Backend Software Developer • Data Engineer • Systems Architect**

I build and ship **scalable backend systems, automated data platforms, and real-world data processing engines** that turn raw telemetry and fragmented operational data into structured intelligence.

---

## 🧠 What I Build

I’m passionate about backend engineering, distributed data pipelines, and building systems that operate reliably in production.

Here’s the kind of work I focus on:

- **Architecting and building backend platforms** using Node.js / Express  
- **Designing relational data models** optimized for performance and analytics  
- **Building ETL and reconciliation pipelines** for high-throughput data ingestion  
- **Integrating external systems** like telemetry APIs (Intangles), WhatsApp notifications, and payment gateways  
- **Deploying cloud infrastructure** and automated workflows on AWS, Azure, and GCP  
- **Engineering AI-assisted analytics systems** for natural-language data exploration
